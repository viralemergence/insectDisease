### insectDisease: Programmatically access insect disease data from the Ecological Database of the World's Insect Pathogens (EDWIP)

See published Software Note in Ecography: ([available here] (https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.06152))
See preprint ([available here](https://ecoevorxiv.org/yd3x5/))

This is a database of known pathogens of many species of insects and other arthropods. This database was designed by David Onstad, and first described in Braxton et al (2003). The database is unique in that in addition to host-parasite associations that occur in nature, it also contains some true host absences: records of instances where a given host species was inoculated with a pathogen and found not to be susceptible to it. This database also contains a large amount of ecological data on hosts and parasites. Here, we document and preserve these data as an R package, also providing csv flatfiles in the `csv` folder. 

Data are available programmatically through R or can be downloaded from the `csv` folder and used outside of R. The data consist of a set of files that maintain the original structure of the EDWIP data resource, with the main files serving to detail the interactions between insect hosts and nematode (`?nematode` or `csv/nematode.csv`), viral ((`?viruses` or `csv/viruses.csv`) and non-viral pathogens such as bacteria and protozoans (`?nvpassoc` or `csv/nvpassoc.csv`). There are also data on negative associations, which are failed inoculation attempts (`?negative` or `csv/negative.csv`) and represent "true zeros", which are rare data. Other information on citations (`assocref`, `citation`, `viraref` and `noassref`) are provided as well as host (`hosts`) and pathogne (`pathogen`) trait data. Cached versions of host and pathogen taxonomy are also included (`hostTaxonomy` and `pathTaxonomy`) and will be updated (along with the taxonomic information within each data product) with every release of the data.

### citation 

Edgelist of known associations between insect host (`Host`) and pathogen (`Pathogen`), and
associated references and indexing values. These data are smaller than assocref, which provides
more data on host-parasite interactions. CreationDate and ModificationDate are incorrect.

---

We believe `assocref` are links and citations for `nvpassoc`, but there are around 3k more rows of data for assocref. However, `nvpassoc` has more unique host-pathogen association data, so the `assocref` data may provide multiple citations for the same interaction.
